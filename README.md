Project Description: Exploratory Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing on Job Satisfaction

In this project, I conducted an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine the relationship between job satisfaction and various factors, such as working mode, gender, income group, job title, marital status, and having children. The project was conducted on a primary dataset, where data cleaning posed a significant challenge.

Data cleaning was an essential step in the project, as the primary dataset contained inconsistencies, missing values, and potential errors. I applied rigorous data cleaning techniques, including handling missing values, addressing outliers, standardizing variable formats, and resolving inconsistencies to ensure the reliability of the analysis.

Once the data cleaning process was completed, I proceeded with the EDA phase. Using various visualizations such as histograms, box plots, bar charts, and scatter plots, I explored the distribution and relationships between job satisfaction and the different factors of interest. The visualizations helped identify patterns, trends, and potential correlations between job satisfaction and the variables under investigation.

Following the EDA, I performed three hypothesis tests to further analyze the relationships between job satisfaction and the identified factors:

1. T-Test: I employed t-tests to examine whether there were significant differences in job satisfaction levels between different groups.I compared job satisfaction between genders.

2. ANOVA: An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to explore the impact of categorical variables on job satisfaction. By considering factors such as job title, marital status, or having children, I investigated whether there were statistically significant differences in job satisfaction across these groups.

3. Chi-Square Test: The chi-square test was utilized to assess the association between categorical variables and job satisfaction. For example, I examined whether there was a significant relationship between job satisfaction and the working mode or gender of the individuals.

Throughout the project, special attention was given to handling the challenging aspects of data cleaning in the primary dataset. By successfully addressing data inconsistencies and errors, I ensured the reliability and accuracy of the subsequent EDA and hypothesis testing phases.

The findings from this project provided valuable insights into the factors influencing job satisfaction. The analysis helped identify significant variations in job satisfaction based on working mode, gender, income group, job title, marital status, and having children. These insights can support organizations in making informed decisions and implementing strategies to enhance job satisfaction among employees, ultimately leading to improved employee well-being and organizational productivity.
